# UnoPlatform.AppTemplate
Template that uses Uno Platform + ReactiveUI + EasyRPC

This repo can be used to create almost any application.
It's ready to use and includes the basic things to start without having to deal too much with packages.

# What does it include?
- Uno Platform
- Reactive UI
- EasyRPC (using ASP.NET Core 3.0)
- Windows Community Toolkit

The application just loads a simple view that delivers data from a service using EasyRPC.

I hope you find it useful!
